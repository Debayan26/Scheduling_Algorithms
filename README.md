# Scheduling_Algorithms
Working of all the scheduling algorithms in Operating System

## Software Pre-requisites

The project is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We used Visual Studio
for the development of software. However to run the project you will not
need any new software. All you need is a stable web browser so that you could
open the HTML page on the browser. Our project is Software Independent.

## Extraction and Run

- First download the zip File of the project.

- Unzip the file in the desired location.

- Once you have extracted the files, you will see a folder named “Scheduling_Algorithms”.

-  Open that Folder, inside the folder open Process "OS2.html" file

- Once you open the Process Scheduling Algorithms (HOMEPAGE).html file, you would see a web page opening up which looks like the image below.


- On topic, we have added a button “Theory” we would give insights about why we use CPU Scheduling Algorithms. It would be advisable to check that out first before using this website, so that the user can have a better understanding of the topic.

- When you click on the button you would be directed to a new webpage. This web page explains in depth about the concepts of CPU Scheduling algorithms. The web page should like the image given below.

- Rest of the buttons represent the various scheduling algorithms. Select one of them according to your choice. We have chosen round robin algorithm for demonstration purpose. You would be directed to a new webpage which looks like the image shown below.

- By clicking on the “Add Process” button, the process would be added into the table on the left side. You can add as many as process you want. You can add another process and repeat this process until you have filled the required data in the table.

- Note: Before diving into the calculation and seeing the visualization it is advisable to first checkout the concept of the algorithm. To do so, we have added a theory button which discusses in depth about the algorithms working, advantages and disadvantages. So, do check it out. Also if you want to make the process schedule with I/O burst time, you can by clicking on I/O burst time button. After adding the processes your schedule would look like the image below. Before diving into Calculations and Visualization it is advisable to first checkout the concept of the algorithm. To do so, we have added a theory button which discusses in depth about the algorithm, its working, advantages and disadvantages.

- Now click on calculate for calculating parameters of schedule like waiting time, turnaround time etc.


- To visualize the working of algorithm and the schedule formed by the algorithm click on the “visualization button”. It will redirect you to a new page which should look like the image below.

- Here you can interactively add process and fill the details like arrival time and see the results in form of Gant Chart. You can also change context switching time, time quantum too.
